# Implicit Roll-Up

This project is related to my master thesis "Implicit Roll-Up over graph based data integration systems" carried out in Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya - UPC upon FIB Data Science department.
This project is an extension of the project [GFDM](https://github.com/pistocchifilippo/NextiaQR) system, that have also been developed by the reserach group I have been working with.
In this repository you can expect to find the following:

1. An OO model able to represent any kind of graph that can be described in NExtiaQR.
2. An implementation of the Implicit Roll-Up algorithm.
3. A DSL able to define a running scenario.
4. A DSL able to define an integration graph.

## The goal
The goal of this project is making an extension to GFDM system, 

## Basic example
